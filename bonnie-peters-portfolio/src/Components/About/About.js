        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Bonnie. I’m a front end developer, traveler, and National Geographic subscriber. Thanks to my grandmother and her library of National Geographic issues when I was growing up, I developed a relentless curiosity to explore different cultures and subjects outside my surrounding world. As an adult, I continue to subscribe to National Geographic and apply what I have learned in those pages about the diversity of humanity to the way I code. I always strive to build applications that speak to people who see things differently than I do. Whatever it takes to make that product, whether its learning a new algorithm, framework, or language, I'm up for the challenge!</p>
