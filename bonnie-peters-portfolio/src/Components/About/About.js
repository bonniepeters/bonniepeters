        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Bonnie. I’m a front end developer, traveler, and National Geographic subscriber. My love of exploration and National Geographic both stem from my grandmother. She taught me to  always wonder at the world around me and to celebrate the opportunity to engage an unfamiliar subject. I carry those values with me as a developer, always energized by the problems I can’t solve with my current knowledge. The opportunity to learn a new algorithm, framework, or language in order to accomplish a task excites me!</p>
