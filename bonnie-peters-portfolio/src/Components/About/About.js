        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Bonnie. I’m a front end developer, traveler, and National Geographic subscriber. Thanks to my grandmother and her library of National Geographic issues when I was growing up, I developed a relentless curiosity to explore cultures and subjects outside my surrounding world. Today, I continue to subscribe to National Geographic and apply that inquisitive nature in my approach to code. The opportunity to dive into a new algorithm, framework, or language in order to accomplish a task is thrilling to me!</p>
